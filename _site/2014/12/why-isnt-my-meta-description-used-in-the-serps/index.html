            <h1>Why isn't my meta description being used in the SERP snippet?</h1>

<p>I've always considered myself pretty good when it comes to basic technical SEO.</p>

<p>We recently launched our new website and are now starting to see some SEO anomalies. Finding the answer to these was not as simple as I thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>The SEO world has moved on ...</p>

<p>We're using the following meta description on our homepage and we want this to display as the snippet in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) for our company name:</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta name="description" content="We are the leading leased and tenanted pub businesses in the UK with a portfolio of over 5,000 pubs." /&gt;</code></p>

<p>This is not what's being displayed.</p>

<p>When searching for 'enterprise inns' in Google, the snippet in the SERP displays:</p>

<blockquote>One of the year's leading events for publicans and potential publicans, Enterprise live will be touring the UK in February and March. Make sure you don't miss ...</blockquote>


<p>While this text does appear on the homepage, this is not an accurate summary of the business.</p>

<h2>Why won't Google just use my meta description?</h2>

<p>The world's moved on, my friend.</p>

<p>Google is a mysterious beast and is constantly changing its algorithm. Depending on who's side you're on, they're ensuring that people are more likely to find something relevant to their search (and making it harder to cheat the results), or they're making life a misery for site owners by constantly moving the goalposts.</p>

<p>I remember the days when some well-chose keywords and a meta description went a long way to having an effect on your ranking. These days, there's a lot more emphasis on the content.</p>

<p>Basically, if Google thinks that the meta description is not a good fit with the content on the page, it won't use it.</p>

<p>It's all about relevance. Google is trying to provide the most relevant content to display based on what they think the user would find useful, based on their search.</p>

<p>There are a lot of factors that influence whether a page is likely to be relevant.</p>

<p>"Meta descriptions are limited to 150 characters (or 120 on mobile, so err on the shorter side when writing these) and trail off similarly to page titles. Meta descriptions have no direct effect on rankings and are often replaced with an actual snippet from the page if Google deems that bit more relevant to the query. Still, if you write a great, keyword-rich meta description, Google will be more likely to use it."</p>
