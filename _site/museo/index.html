            <h1>Goodbye WordPress, hello Jekyll</h1>

<p class="intro drop-cap">This is where the introductory paragraph will go. It will be a short intro to the article and will summarise what the content's conclusion is to help the reader.</p>


<p>You may be staring at these words dead-eyed but if you <em>do</em> have a hand in the air then have you ever considered using a flat-file CMS (you can put your hand down now)? They're also called 'static site generators' or 'flat-file CMSs'. <a href="http://www.typeandgrids.com/blog/goodbye-wordpress-2014-will-be-the-year-of-flat-file-cmses" title="A move away from WordPress in 2014?">This article</a> explains it. Apart from the ease of working with just HTML for writing templates, you can also host your site <em>for free</em> using GitHub pages.</p>

<p>I've seen a rash of articles (one, maybe two) explaining the benefits of using flat-file CMSs. I decided to try out <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I'll explain how that went in a moment. And before you accuse me of bandwagon jumping, I started writing this article before I read this article on getting started with GitHub Pages. And definitely before I'd heard of this one about the rise of flat file CMSs.</p>

<p>I'm just a slow writer.</p>

<h2>So why now then Mr. Bandwagon Jumper?</h2>

<p>Yes, I could have just reinstalled WordPress. Yes I could have just recovered the broken database. Actually, I did try <em>both</em> those things but it didn't go well. I then got all existential and decided it was futile. Serves me right for reading.</p>

<p>Anyway, all my site had was a few pages, images, and a couple of blog posts that didn't need reviving. I looked out of the window for inspiration. All I saw was the top of a flat and a pigeon. I turned back to my monitor and looked at the database error again.</p>

<p>That was that. I decided that it was just too bloated for a simple portfolio site. I'd wasted miserable hours tip-toeing around PHP code and messing with local servers. I also live in a house with my family and I like to see them now and again (I hope the feeling's mutual).</p>

<p>I'd heard a bit about Jekyll and noticed that <a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Robert's</a> site, <a href="http://csswizardry.com/" title="CSS Wizardry">CSS Wizardry</a>  uses it.</p>

<p>Time for action...</p>

<h2>Working with it</h2>

<p>Once I'd installed Jekyll, it was easy to work with. You can follow a tutorial on the official <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a> site to see what I mean.</p>

<p>As it's based on flat files, it's <em>very</em> easy to get going with and this also makes it easy for it to fit in with a SASS/LESS workflow as there's little to get in the way.</p>

<h2>Hosting with GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>This is one of the best bits. You can host your site on GitHub Pages for free. This is also easy to do and you can even use your own custom domain name.</p>

<p>It takes a small amount of setting up but this makes deployment easy. Just commit your changes to GitHub (in a specially named branch) and the files are deployed.</p>

<p>You can find more detailed info on <a href="http://benhowdle.im/2013/11/21/hosting-your-site-or-portfolio-on-github/">how to host your site or portfolio on github</a>.</p>

<h2>Things to think about</h2>

<p>Unless you pay for a private GitHub account, your source code will be available for the world to see. Is this a big problem? That's up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Also, this won't work if you have a dynamic website. Stick with WordPress for that.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Here's my short summary on using Jekyll for a small website:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete bitch to set up for someone allergic to the command line like me.</li>
<li>Definitely worth the effort.</li>
</ul>


<p>Making changes is easy and fits in better with my current workflow than WordPress. While it's an excellent CMS, WordPress is just too overblown for a static site like mine.</p>
