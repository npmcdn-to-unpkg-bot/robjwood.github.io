            <h1>npower</h1>

<p><em>Senior Front End Web Developer</em></p>

<p><strong>February 2006 â€“ July 2012 (6 years 6 months)</strong></p>

<p>I looked after the front end of npower's residential website. I worked on many projects including:</p>

<ul>
<li>B2B website</li>
<li>Buy online website</li>
<li>Web support team's customer account website</li>
<li>Online Bill View website.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h2>What did I do?</h2>

<p>I worked on all manner of work from the day-to-day amends to high profile projects.</p>

<p>These are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've coded 3 different iterations of the residential energy application form. We streamlined the code resulting in an increase in from completions.</li>
<li>I built the HTML for the 'Green' section of the npower.com website.</li>
<li>Built energy application form for small to medium businesses. The project included a consumption calculator and a 4-stage application form.</li>
<li>Worked on a new online billing system for residential customers.</li>
<li>I built a website for the web support team allowing them quicker access to customer information. This allowed for quicker response times.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>I started as a contract web developer in 2006 when the team was small (8 of us in total). When I left the team was over thirty strong. I went permanent in 2010 as a senior front end web developer.</p>

<p>My focus has always been on front end development with a focus on HTML and CSS. I've also done a lot of work within a .NET environment.</p>

<p>My senior role saw me more involved in management of the operational front end work as well as the web projects.</p>
