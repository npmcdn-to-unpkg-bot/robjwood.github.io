    <h2>Enterprise Inns</h2>
    <p><i>Web Developer</i></p>
    <p>Copy.</p>
</div>


<h2>npower</h2>

<p><em>Senior Front End Web Developer</em></p>

<h3>What do I do?</h3>

<p>I've been involved in all manner of work from the day-to-day amends to high profile projects.</p>

<p>These are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've coded 3 different iterations of the residential energy application form. The code was streamlined and we recorded an increase in all cases.</li></li>
<li>I built HTML for the 'Green' section of the npower.com website. This was to brand our green offering separately in support of advertising in other media.</li></li>
<li>Built energy application form for small to medium businesses. The project included a consumption calculator and a 4-stage application form.</li></li>
<li>Worked on a new online billing system for residential customers.</li></li>
<li>Built the  website for the web support team, allowing them direct access to customer information to allow rapid response to support calls.</li></li>
</ul>


<h3>How it started</h3>

<p>I started as contract web developer in 2006 when the team was pretty small (8 of us in total). The team is now over 40 strong. I went permanent in 2010 as a senior front end web developer.</p>

<p>My focus has always been on front end development; specifically HTML and CSS (various flavours). A lot of the work I’ve done during my time at npower has been doing this within .NET applications so I’ve become comfortable working within this environment (and getting used to its quirks!).</p>

<p>My senior role has seen me more involved in management of the day-to-day work that comes to the front end team, but I still get involved in various web projects.</p>
