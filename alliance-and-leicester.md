# Alliance & Leicester

_Web Editor/Developer_

**January 2001 – April 2004 (3 years 4 months)**

I was responsible for updating, maintaining and developing websites and developing new functionality.

I created and optimised graphics using Photoshop, Flash and Fireworks. I created and edited pages using Dreamweaver, XHTML, JavaScript and ASP. I also ensured we followed W3C accessibility guidelines.

I helped redesign and redevelop the Alliance & Leicester websites and improveme the dynamic Useful Tools Centre. I also helped to bring e-mail campaigns in house and to manage the database information.
