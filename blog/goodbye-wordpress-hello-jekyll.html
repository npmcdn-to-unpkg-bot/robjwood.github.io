<p>Hey you!</p>
<p>Raise your hand if any of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a simple site</li>
<li>You like writing in Markdown.</li>
<li>You use GitHub.</li>
<li>You&#39;ve had <em>any</em> frustrations with WordPress.</li>
<li>You would like to host your site for free on a reliable platform.</li>
<li>You&#39;re a little bit scared of databases (even though you act all tough in front of your friends).</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be staring at these words dead-eyed but if you <em>do</em> have a hand in the air then have you ever considered using a flat-file CMS (you can put your hand down now)?</p>
<h2>A what?</h2><p>You heard.</p>
<p>They&#39;re also called &#39;static site generators&#39;, &#39;flat-file CMSs&#39; or &#39;Supergran&#39;s Flowery Wrist Cobblers (probably). <a href="http://www.typeandgrids.com/blog/goodbye-wordpress-2014-will-be-the-year-of-flat-file-cmses" title="A move away from WordPress in 2014?">This article</a> explains it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A flat-file CMS is a content management system that stores content in files and folders rather than in a database like a traditional CMS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well said.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s the point?</h2><p>Apart from the ease of working with just HTML for writing templates, you can also host your site <em>for free</em> using GitHub pages.</p>
<h2>It&#39;s not just me</h2><p>I&#39;ve seen a rash of articles (one, maybe two) explaining the benefits of using flat-file CMSs. I decided to try out <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I&#39;ll explain how that went in a moment. And before you accuse me of bandwagon jumping, I started writing this article before I read <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/" title="Get Started With GitHub Pages (Plus Bonus Jekyll)">this article on getting started with GitHub Pages</a>, and definitely before I&#39;d even heard of <a href="http://www.typeandgrids.com/blog/goodbye-wordpress-2014-will-be-the-year-of-flat-file-cmses" title="A move away from WordPress in 2014?">this one about the rise of flat file CMSs</a>. </p>
<p>I&#39;m just a slow writer.  </p>
<h2>So why now then Mr. Bandwagon Jumper?</h2><p>A WordPress update failed, that&#39;s why.</p>
<p>Yes, I could have just reinstalled WordPress. Yes I could have just recovered the broken database. Actually, I did try <em>both</em> those things but it didn&#39;t go well. I then got all existential and decided it was futile. Serves me right for reading.</p>
<p>Anyway, all my site had was a few pages, images, and a couple of blog posts that really didn&#39;t need reviving. I asked myself this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I really <em>need</em> WordPress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked out of the window for inspiration. All I saw was the top of a flat and a pigeon. I turned back to my monitor and looked at the database error again. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I <em>don&#39;t</em> need WordPress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was that. I decided that it was just too bloated for a simple portfolio site. I&#39;d whiled away many not-particularly-enjoyable hours tip-toeing around PHP code and messing with local servers, and not enough time on building the website. I also live in a house with my family and I like to see them now and again (I&#39;ve no idea if the feeling&#39;s mutual).</p>
<p>I&#39;d heard a bit about Jekyll and noticed that <a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Robert&#39;s</a> site, <a href="http://csswizardry.com/" title="CSS Wizardry">CSS Wizardry</a>  uses it. </p>
<p>Time for action...</p>
<h2>Install Jekyll, and hide</h2><p>Sorry, I had to use that pun.</p>
<p>I decided to dive straight into installing and using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing Jekyll</h3><p>This isn&#39;t a how-to guide. This is a personal account of how it went for me. I&#39;ve decided to keep it raw and messy to get across how I felt. You can skip this is you want. It contains swearing and exclamation marks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load up the official <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll docs</a>.</strong> That&#39;s easy.</li>
<li><strong>Open Terminal.</strong> Oh God. I knew I&#39;d have to do this. It&#39;s OK. It does scare the hell out of me though. After an hour of typing gibberish into a black window, it <em>still</em> hasn&#39;t installed. Shit.</li>
<li><strong>Install <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Sudo</em>, <em>Command line Tools</em> in <em>Xcode</em> and other stuff.</strong> <em>Why?</em></li>
<li><strong>Update to the latest version of <em>Ruby</em>.</strong> Bugger. It hasn&#39;t bloody worked. </li>
<li><strong>Install <em>Xcode</em>.</strong> Er, OK. It&#39;s so I can install <em>Command Line Tools</em> apparently? What the hell <em>for</em>? WHY?</li>
<li><strong>Cry a lot.</strong> NOOOO! The version of <em>Xcode</em> I tried to download is only for the latest version of Mac OS. Great. My 2007 MacBook isn&#39;t supported by the latest OS either.</li>
<li><strong>Install older version <em>Xcode</em>.</strong> I&#39;ve got to go to the developer site and try to find it. The installed file size is over 3.54GB! I don&#39;t have that much space left on my hard drive! I need to delete stuff now! Calm down! It&#39;s late. Go to bed. And stop talking to yourself.</li>
<li><strong>I hate the command line</strong></li>
<li><strong>Try to Install <em>Xcode</em> again.</strong> After waiting several days (that&#39;s how it felt) for <em>Xcode</em> to install, it <em>still</em> fails! Why are you doing this to me! I&#39;m now fumbling around the internet and I&#39;ve managed to install <em>Command Line Tools</em> (didn&#39;t have to install <em>Xcode</em> after all, grrr...). I&#39;ll just try installing it again and...IT F*CKING WORKED! I&#39;ve never been so happy to see so much code I don&#39;t understand scrolling past me in Terminal. THANK YOU INTERNET!!!</li>
<li><strong>Cry a lot (again).</strong> FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE!!!. It <em>hasn&#39;t</em> worked. It HAS NOT WORKED.</li>
<li><strong>Install JSON.</strong> After wiping the blood and tears (no sweat) off the keyboard, and more fumbling around the internet, I&#39;ve now need to install JSON via the command line too! Why? <em>WHY?</em></li>
<li><strong>Install something called <em>rdiscount</em>.</strong> What the hell is this now? <em>Another</em> thing to install. ANOTHER THING. What are all these things I need to install?! What are THINGS? I <em>hate</em> the word &#39;THINGS&#39;. Anyway, I think if I was told I&#39;d need to install something called <em>virus.exe</em> I just do it blindly. I&#39;m feeling desperate now.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate wildly</strong> OH SWEET JESUS! It worked! I think it <em>really</em> worked!</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the picture. It was a pain.</p>
<h2>Working with it</h2><p>Once it was installed, it was very easy to work with. You can follow a tutorial on the official <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a> site to see what I mean.</p>
<p>As it&#39;s based on flat files, it&#39;s <em>very</em> easy to get going with and this also makes it easy for it to fit in with a SASS/LESS workflow as there&#39;s very little to get in the way.</p>
<h2>Hosting with GitHub Pages</h2><p>This is one of the best bits. You can host your site on GitHub Pages for free. This is also <em>very</em> easy to do and you can even use your own custom domain name. </p>
<p>It takes a small amount of setting up but this makes deployment easy. Just commit your changes to GitHub (in a specially named branch) and the files are deployed.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed info on <a href="http://benhowdle.im/2013/11/21/hosting-your-site-or-portfolio-on-github/">how to host your site or portfolio on github</a>.</p>
<h2>Things to think about</h2><p>Unless you pay for a private GitHub account, your source code will be available for the world to see. Is this a big problem? That&#39;s up to you to decide.</p>
<p>Also, this won&#39;t really work if you have a dynamic website. Probably best to stick with WordPress for that.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2><p>Here&#39;s my incredibly brief summary on using Jekyll for a small website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete bitch to set up for someone allergic to the command line like me.</li>
<li>Definitely worth the effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making changes is easy and fits in better with my current workflow than WordPress. Whil it&#39;s an excellent CMS, WordPress is just too overblown for a static site like mine.</p>
