<h1>Going lo-fi</h1><ul>
<li>Possibly tired of &#39;current&#39; trends, flat design, skeuomorphic whatever.</li>
<li>Using MD more.</li>
<li>Using Dropbox and plain text files.</li>
<li>Certain software makes it hard to get your data out (Evernote, Google?)</li>
<li>GitHub.</li>
<li>It&#39;s lighter and quicker.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few websites that I used to admire back in the day and I&#39;ve realised that although many are now gone - or redesigned - there are a few that are still going strong.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.coudal.com/">http://www.coudal.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mezzoblue.com/">http://mezzoblue.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/">http://daringfireball.net/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.particletree.com/">http://www.particletree.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lukew.com/">http://www.lukew.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">http://www.reddit.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I appreciate that things move forward and that there are good reasons for a website to change but there will always be design trends that come then go. There&#39;s nothing wrong with seeing a trend and using it in your own work when you think there&#39;s a banefit to it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to avoid seeing the latest trends in web design and development and feeling compelled to compare your own work against it. I&#39;ve spent many hours looking through design galleries, typography tutorials etc. It&#39;s all pointless really.</p>
<p>Making your site look good is important, don&#39;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I think what I like about these lo-fi sites is that they seem more trustworthy somehow. When I see a site that contains parallax scrolling, huge header images, &#39;popular&#39; typefaces. It feels like the site has been more cynically put together, like it&#39;s trying to trick me somehow.     </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a designer as much as a little voice inside me tells me I <em>could</em> be.</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance - It may be faster to load a system font but you don&#39;t have the same control over how it renders. Does serving a single webfont to the browser really make <em>that</em> much difference? Probably not but every little helps (as a famous supermarket would no doubt say if they had an opinion on these things).</li>
<li>Consistency - I often felt that choosing a webfont was the only choice if you wanted to ensure they font looked basically the same everywhere. This isn&#39;t true. I&#39;ve tested many fonts on both a Mac and a windows machine. It&#39;s true that certain fonts don&#39;t render well on certain Windows/Browser combinataions but you&#39;ve also got mobile to think about. How does it render in Safari on iOS? What about Chrome on Android 4.2 devices. What about the Android stock browser? What about any of the other browsers that users can use on Android. For my personal site, it&#39;s just not possible to check this. There&#39;s a lot to be said for instructing the browser to use a default system font.</li>
<li>Readability - There&#39;s a little subjectivity to this one. No doubt a tiny font is going to be less readable to most people it seems that other aspects of readability are still open to debate, no matter how much science there is behind each view. Serif or Sans? I&#39;ve seen inconclusive data for both.</li>
<li>Aesthetics - This is obviously subjective. </li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s about content really.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important for your choices not to ruin the users experience. I&#39;ve seen design decisions that just make it harder for the user to get around the website. I&#39;ve seen websites that contain little more than text and because of the fear of a having a &#39;boring&#39; website that doesn&#39;t &#39;pop&#39;, designers have decided to do something a little different.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not against trying something new but often.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&#39;s down to presenting your content with the minimum of friction. <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/words.html">This article</a> sums it up nicely.</p></div></div></div></div><hr><footer><div class="wrapper cf"><div class="grid"><div class="grid__item palm-one-whole one-half testimonial"><p>"Rob worked as a web developer for one of my clients and did an excellent job.
