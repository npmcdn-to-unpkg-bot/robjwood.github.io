I mean in life really but obviously on this website too. I'm never totally sure what the best practice is for 404 pages like these. For a tiny website like mine it's probably not worth worrying about but it does play on my mind, to be honest.</p><p>I bet nobody reaching this page will actually read this far. I'd like to think that they will have clicked on a link somewhere -- the links in the header bar would be a good place to try -- but they'll probably just go to another website.</p><p>You're not like them though, are you?</p><p>I like you. You're polite enough to hang around and though it's likely you don't want to be here. You're reading on anyway just so you don't seem rude. I like that.</p><p>Anyway, I've taken up _way_ too much of your time already and I don't even know your name. Mine's Rob. I have no idea what you were trying to find so all I can do is point you to the top of the page and ask you to try the links there.</p></div></div></div></div><hr><footer><div class="wrapper cf"><ol class="breadcrumb"></ol></div></footer></body></html>
