<h3 id="bethesda-county-school-report">Bethesda County School report</h3>
<p>We found this report at Nain&#39;s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivor Jones has attended this school regularly and punctually for two sessions and a term and during this period he has not progressed much in academic subjects, but has been interested in practical subjects.</p>
<p>He is a quiet lad whose conduct has been most satisfactory and in our experience he is truthful, obediant and reliable. While not likely to succeed in studious pursuits I have no doubt he will succeed in some form of craftwork.</p>
