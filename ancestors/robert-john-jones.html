<p>He served in the 8th Kings Royal Irish Hussars in WWII. He was part of C Squadron.</p>
<p>He was killed in action. Here&#39;s a excerpt of a letter from Major P. H. Huth to his parents, dated 6 September 1944:</p>
<pre><code>It is with very deep regret that I have to write this letter. You will have heard by now through official channels that your son was killed by action on the night of the 19th/20 August.

On that date my squadron was fairly heavily bombed, and a direct hit was scored on a supply vehicle of which your son was the driver. He and two companions who were sleeping near to him were killed instantly.

Your son had not been with my squadron very long, but it was long enough for me to realise what a useful member of my squadron I have lost.

He will be mourned by all of his friends and always remembered by the officers and men of my squadron, who join with you in sharing your great loss.

Yours very sincerely
??? Huth

P.S. He was buried with his two companions by our regimental padre.
</code></pre><p>The date of his death is unsure. His headstone says 19th August 1944, but the war diaries may suggest that his squadron didn&#39;t see action on that day.</p>
