Surnames on the chart are Jones, Swinford, Wilson, Oldham, Bentham, Hughes, Morgan, Evans, Williams, Griffith and Roberts.  Covers from 1451-1906. One of the descendants lands up in the Chester Workhouse in England, and marries Elizabeth Cunninghame in Jan. 1900. Article in Journal &quot;Hel Achau&#39; #20 christmas 1986, page 5-6.

<p>  AMONG the pioneers of education in Wales not the least eminent was the Rev. Arthur Jones, D.D., of Bangor. He was an ardent, and in his quaint way a gifted teacher. He was born May 12th, 1776, at the mill-house of Felin Isa, Llanrwst, and was the son of a well-to-do miller. His mother, Ellen Ellis Morgan, was a daughter of Ellis Morgan, of Pentre, Dolwyddelen, Carnarvon- shire, and was a woman of unusual ability. Among her forefathers was William Morgan, D.D., 1540-1604, who translated the Bible into Welsh about 1587, and was born at Gwyber- nant, in the parish of Permachno, Carnarvon- shire. Arthur Jones was always glad to know that in his veins there was the blood of the famous Bishop., He had been taught as a child by his mother that her great ancestor had done a work in his day of which his children for all time might well be proud. The boy was quick and intelligent. Accompanied by his dogs, of which he was passionately fond, he wandered over the mountains around Llanrwst searching for traces of the unwritten life of the Bishop, always to be met with at the shepherd&#39;s fire- side, and among a people deeply attached to tradition, as mountaineers are in every country. </p>
<p>  And in later years he would describe with great zest the boyish adventures through which he passed at such times. And again and again he would dwell on the wonderful goodness of God in having saved him from youthful wrongdoing.</p>
<p>  We are told that he would go over the history of his boyhood with exactness and precision, give a clear and vivid account of the mountain passes through which he had wandered times untold, and explain in the most interesting way the best spots from which to get a view of the valleys and glens lying in repose at the foot of the mountains. He would tell of cataracts and waterfalls, filled with apparitions and hobgoblins that had been seen by old women now long dead. When Arthur Jones was a boy he was full of life and merriment, and was regarded by his playmates as their champion and leader in all games and sports. In jumping, running, throwing things, and playing marbles, no one could beat him, for he could do nothing by halves, and whatever he did he did it with all his might. In this the boy was to prove father to the man. But in course of time he grew tired of such juvenile diversions and sought for pleas- ures of a more exciting sort. He struck up i friendship with a clergyman who was an expert in bird-snaring and poaching, and youth and man could often be seen, followed by their dogs, hurrying over hills and along by-roads and paths, and pushing their way through woods and thickets. Yet Arthur Jones soon grew restless and dissatisfied. Writing of those days many years afterwards he said that he was already conscious of the need of something which that kind of life could not give him, and that the sporting clergyman in all the talks he had with him never mentioned to him the story of the prodigal son, no one ever drew his attention to Luke xv., 16 And he would fain have been filled with the husks that the swine did eat but no man gave unto him.&quot; Yet in course of time he himself met with the verse, and also became persuaded that God in His great love did not mean that he should have to feed on what was fit only for swine. Yet it is not a little remarkable that at this very time Arthur Jones made himself notorious as a bitter persecutor of the Nonconformists in the district. His uncle, John Ellis Morgan, who took great interest in him, was a bigoted churchman, and regarded all dissenters with undisguised contempt and bitter hatred. Arthur&#39;s mother, too, had always taught him that Nonconformity was a vile offence. So that he quickly became infected with his uncle&#39;s spirit, and being a strong and reckless young man, he soon proved himself a terror to humble Christians who met on the mountain side or in the lonely cabin to worship God in accordance with their own convictions of what was right. In fact, he seldom missed an opportunity of attacking the gatherings. On one occasion, having heard that a prayer meeting was to be held on a certain evening in a farmhouse at Bettws-y-Coed, Arthur and his uncle decided to go there, each with a strong cudgel to strike down the first man they found praying. When they arrived the service had begun, and they stood by the window of the room where it was being held, and listened to the simple and earnest prayers. When the meeting was over and the people began to come out, the older man shouted to his nephew, Strike, Arthur, strike! But there was no strength in Arthur&#39;s arm to use the cudgel. Be a man and strike,&quot; reiterated his now famous uncle, threatening to disown him and to leave his patrimony to others. But it was all in vain. The influence of the prayer had entirely unnerved the young man, and the roaring lion had been changed into a meek and innocent lamb. Arthur was never the same cruel bigot as before. When he was 21 years of age, Arthur Jones became a true Christian, which event he himself describes as follows: â€” &quot;I I led a somewhat wild life,&quot; he says, until Whit Monday in the year 1797, when I attended a preaching meeting at Capel Curig.
