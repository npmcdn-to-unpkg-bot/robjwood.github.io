<h1 id="starting-again">Starting again</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to start my website from scratch (again). I want to strip it down to give myself a place to put my code and document what I&#39;m doing. I tend to play around with things then move on and forget what I&#39;ve learned.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll probably change my mind but for now, here it is.</p>
