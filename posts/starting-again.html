  <h1 id="starting-again">Starting again</h1>
<p>Depending on when you&#39;re reading this, it may look like this website&#39;s broken. By broken, I mean readable, fast and easy to use. </p>
<p>The only styles are a <code>maximum-width</code> here, and <code>font-weight</code> there.</p>
<h2 id="why-">Why?</h2>
<p>I want to start from basically nothing and only add a little at a time.</p>
<p>I also want to start documenting what I&#39;m doing a little more and worrying less about writing a prefectly worded post.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found that writing helps me think through a problem better and putting it out in public will hopefully persuade me to focus a little more.</p>
<h2 id="why-else-">Why else?</h2>
<p>Over the last year or so I&#39;ve started to notice some of the older website out and wondered why.</p>
<p>I was partly inspired my <a href="https://micah.codes/" title="Micah Godbolt">Micah Godbolt&#39;s website</a> which has no styles at all. I also remember seeing Richard Stallman&#39;s website and being struck by how it looked. Mainly because I thought I&#39;d time-travelled to 1995. I liked that.</p>
<p>The reason I&#39;ve done it is to try and focus on the content first and actually get some changes live withouth my usual excuses. Excuses like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once I&#39;ve sorted the way the font-size changes on a tablet device I&#39;ll launch it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t launch anything without adjusting the order of the comments in the CSS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t even bothered with Google Analytics this time either as it didn&#39;t reallt help me. I spent more time filtering out spam so I could more easily view the behaviour of my six visitors a month.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll probably change my mind but for now, here it is.</p>
