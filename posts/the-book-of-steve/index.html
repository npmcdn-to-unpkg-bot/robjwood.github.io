<p>This hasn&#39;t been written yet but here are the things that could go into it.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-conversation">Topics of conversation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rats.</li>
<li>Protesters making him late for work.</li>
<li>Cryptography.</li>
<li>Richard Branson.</li>
<li>Dead people&#39;s utility bills.</li>
<li>His rabbits and ducks being &#39;ripped apart&#39; by foxes.</li>
<li>Squirrels come into his kitchen.</li>
<li>Sleeping somehwere that&#39;s not home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="random">Random</h2>
<p>Fat character in Harry Potter who has a wand stuck up his nose that his kids thought was him.</p>
<p>Thought that if he pulled a bit of cotton on his sleeve that the whole cuff would fall off.</p>
<p>Now he&#39;s just suggested men put their wedding rings through their noses so they can be pulled around by their wives (and gave a chuckle that include six &#39;ha&#39;s).</p>
<h2 id="actual-conversations-i-ve-heard">Actual conversations I&#39;ve heard</h2>
<p>Most of these I&#39;ve been an active participant in, others I just overheard.</p>
<p>When I mentioned the squirrels in my garden hiding nuts he said: &quot;What, chewing your nuts?&quot; and he started chuckling. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not jealous?&quot; another chuckle. &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;d give you some if you asked&quot; another chuckle. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Call me sceptical...no, not testicle!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve: &quot;Things are getting good (accompanied by a sort of dance-thing)!&quot;<br>Me: &quot;What are?&quot;<br>Steve: &quot;Everything!&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Everything? That&#39;s quite broad.&quot;<br>Steve: &quot;Are you saying I&#39;m broad? Ha, ha!&quot;  </p>
<p>Ten minutes later, doing that dance-thing again, accompanied by a chant of &quot;Go Stevie, go Stevie!&quot;. </p>
<p>Iain came to his desk with bacon in a bun and Steve&#39;s response was:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just admiring Iain&#39;s baps! Huh huh!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Told me about Burgen bread and how he spends a lot of time picking the seeds out of his teeth.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just after 9 and he&#39;s got a nosebleed and is wondering if the first-aider is female. Then told me that he&#39;s just pulled the clot out of his nose. No blood thank God.</p>
<p>He&#39;s now telling me about the hand cream he&#39;s just bought as he&#39;s &quot;a bit dry, like&quot;. He&#39;s also said that he &quot;...won&#39;t need the missus&#39; soft hands round me... <em>chuckle</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Told him I was knackered after the weeked and he replied: &quot;Oh, you were up all night shagging as well ... oh!&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The lettuce was a bit wet on my turkey salad. The mayonnaise just shot out...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Steve: &quot;My fingers are really cold.&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Yeah, the weather&#39;s gone shit.&quot;<br>Steve: &quot;I thought you were calling me a shit then!&quot;  </p>
<hr>
<p>Steve told me a story about an American who spent his life&#39;s savings at a local fair to win a prize. He was unhappy to find that he&#39;d won a banana with dreadlocks. </p>
<hr>
<p>Talking about one of his friends who is a lesbian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s a waste being a lesbian. You&#39;re not allowed to say that, are you?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, he told me that about when he was &quot;just having a piss, like&quot; and someone in there &quot;sounded like they was blowing a trumpet&quot;. He then proceeded to make a farting sound (just to clarify).</p>
<hr>
<p>These were the first words uttered by Steve before he even sat down.</p>
<p>This was closely followed by:</p>
<p>Steve: &quot;My fingers are really cold.&quot;<br>Me: &quot;The weather&#39;s gone shit.&quot;<br>Steve: &quot;I thought you were calling me a shit then!&quot;  </p>
<p>All that before he&#39;s even logged in...</p>
<hr>
<p>Steve&#39;s been telling me about Simon, a half-Bangladeshi friend of his who drowned three years ago. He was recounting the story of how he died, and I asked if he was alone. Apparently, he was swimming in the ocean with a guy called Adam &quot;who was a woofter, like&quot; and they&#39;d both gone out of their depth. Simon was taken under by a wave and was shouting to Adam: &quot;Help, like!&quot; but it was sadly too late.</p>
<hr>
<p>Quiet morning so far other than Steve welcoming me by telling me that Angelina Jolie&#39;s &quot;had her boobs cut off&quot; (I think he means a masectomy).</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I fucking hate sleeves&quot;. This is Steve&#39;s first annoyance of the day.</p>
<p>When describing the salmon he had at some posh do he said it smelt: &quot;... like some sweaty bitch I met years ago&quot;.</p>
<p>Telling me again about Bergen bread and how it&#39;s good for nursing mothers.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m going for Gypsies [kiss]&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;From back here it looked like you was having a shandy!&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Been quiet recently but got this message from Steve:</p>
<p>&quot;i got a broken nail bit .. and it feels like my arm has been ripped off .. how can such a little shitty bit hurt so freakin bad !!!&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Steve has just told me that he was eating his sandwich and he thought it tasted weird. It&#39;s because it&#39;s chicken.</p>
<p>Why is that weird? He thought it was ham. He&#39;s here all week folks.</p>
<hr>
<p>Steve has also told me about a hairdressers he used to go to at the Swan. He was a &quot;gay fella&quot; who used to stand &quot;too close&quot; to him while he was cutting his hair, rubbing his groin in his back.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;What do you think? Should I help a brother out?&quot;</p>
<p>I carried on working but out the corner of my eye I could see a the outline of his head change to show more facial features. He was looking at me.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Sigh..</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Steve. He&#39;s been a little quiet today apart from this:</p>
<p>Steve: &quot;Aaagh! I&#39;ve got something in my eye!&quot;<br>Tej: &quot;An eyeball?&quot;<br>S: &quot;Nah, I hate it when you&#39;ve got something in your eye.&quot;<br>T: &quot;Actually, I&#39;m not going to joke around him. He&#39;d probably take a chunk out of me or something.&quot;<br>S: &quot;Especially when you&#39;re talking about my balls.&quot;<br>T: &quot;Eh?&quot;<br>S: &quot;Oh no, eyeballs.&quot;<br>T: <em>pointing</em> &quot;I&#39;m going to go that way now.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Steve: &quot;I need a fucking wall or something to scratch my back on.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>A cow got into Steve&#39;s his kitchen and it couldn&#39;t turn round.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck me; that&#39;s a big breakfast!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was milking it for forty minutes until I realised it was a bull.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I fucking hate pens&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>He&#39;s going into the finer points of his love of lamb but also his love of goat. In his view, the &quot;people over here don&#39;t seem to like it. You know, white people&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a mute point&quot;.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s Steve story:</p>
<p>He smashed some plates late at night and nobody woke up (although the dog did go &quot;brrRRRR&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;You know, barking up the stairs like, you know?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Apparently, Steve once pulled a muscle in his throat by yawning. He thought he was going to die as he couldn&#39;t breath.</p>
<hr>
<p>I asked if anyone had watched Silent Witness last night. Steve&#39;s response:</p>
<p>&quot;I once wrapped a worm in a piece of lettuce and tried to feed it to my rabbit. He must have smelled the worm because he wouldn&#39;t eat it. He loves lettuce&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>Steve&#39;s mate &#39;Dave Dark&#39; tried laminating a slice of cheese.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Laminating fluff and a fly DID work, however.</p>
<hr>
<p>Steve was scratching his back with his ruler because &quot;the hair must be matted&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#39;No goddam computers&#39;. says Steve to nobody in particular. He seems to have a weird form of Tourettes.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Innit, Rob&quot;<br>&quot;Eh?&quot;<br>&quot;I was just telling Wiz, I found this on me babby&#39;s window sill&quot;, he turns his monitor round.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a may-fly. Well, a may-fly moult.&quot;<br>&quot;Ah.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s looks like a transformer or something doesn&#39;t it?&quot;.<br>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah. He&#39;s only 9 like, but he came running in saying &#39;There&#39;s a scorpion in my room!&#39;, but it was only a may-fly moult. It was only about an inch long.  </p>
<p>Nav. You seen this?&quot;</p>
<p>Nav then gets treated to the same story. Andy walks past Steve&#39;s desk. Steve shouts out:</p>
<p>&quot;Andy, I found this on my babby&#39;s window sill&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>Me: &quot;It&#39;s a little bit chilly&quot;
Steve: &quot;You&#39;ve got a little what?&quot;</p>
