	<h1>Gabriel Agbonlahor: No Aston Villa action after 'shisha pipe' picture</h1>
	<p>Aston Villa say they will take no further action against striker Gabriel Agbonlahor after investigating his conduct on a recent trip to Dubai.</p>
	<p>Villa suspended Agbonlahor and carried out an investigation after he was pictured appearing to hold a shisha pipe during the international break.</p>
	<p>The 29-year-old striker missed Saturday's 4-0 defeat by Chelsea.</p>
	<p>Villa have lost their past seven games and are 15 points from safety with six Premier League matches remaining.</p>
	<p>The club's caretaker boss Eric Black, who took over as manager after Remi Garde left, took the decision to remove the Englishman from the squad to face Chelsea because he did not want to "distract the players".</p>
	<p>Agbonlahor is Villa's longest-serving current player but has scored just once in 18 appearances during a turbulent campaign for the West Midlands side.</p>
	<p>Villa have won only three league games and will be relegated on Saturday when they host Bournemouth if 17th-placed Norwich, who are at Crystal Palace, better their result.</p>
	<p>Even if Villa match Norwich's result they would effectively be down as they would remain 15 points adrift of the Canaries with five games left and a goal difference 19 worse than the Carrow Road side.</p>

	<p>This article says a lot about Villa.</p>
