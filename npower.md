## What did I do?

I worked on all manner of work from the day-to-day amends to high profile projects.

These are the highlights:

- I've coded 3 different iterations of the residential energy application form. We streamlined the code resulting in an increase in from completions.
- I built the HTML for the 'Green' section of the npower.com website.
- Built energy application form for small to medium businesses. The project included a consumption calculator and a 4-stage application form.
- Worked on a new online billing system for residential customers.
- I built a website for the web support team allowing them quicker access to customer information. This allowed for quicker response times.

## How it started

I started as a contract web developer in 2006 when the team was small (8 of us in total). When I left the team was over thirty strong. I went permanent in 2010 as a senior front end web developer.

My focus has always been on front end development with a focus on HTML and CSS. I've also done a lot of work within a .NET environment.

My senior role saw me more involved in management of the operational front end work as well as the web projects.
