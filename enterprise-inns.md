# Enterprise Inns

_Web Developer_

## What do I do?

I'm the front end developer working on the main [Enterprise Inns website](enterpriseinns.com "Enterprise Inns") and intranet.

The current site is built on SharePoint 2010 with a move to SharePoint 2013 later this year. 

The latest site is built on Share a point 2013 and has been built using a scalable architecture. It uses the Inuit framework.

The Intranet serves the whole company and caters for both office based and field staff.

## Intranet

We built the Intranet from designs supplied by an external agency.
