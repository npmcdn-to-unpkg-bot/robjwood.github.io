<li>Taid was in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and joined in 1944.</li>
<li>He spent much of his active time in Germany, and was in Berlin for a while.</li>
<li>He was involved in helping at Belsen concentration camp, and saw some horrible things.</li>
<li>I think he was briefly a corporal/lieutenant.</li>
<li>Part of his training was in Brecon (Royal Welch Regiment), and some in Bradford (West Yorkshire Regiment). </li>
<li>He first travelled to the continent, from Harwich to the Hook of Holland (I think).</li>
</ul>
<h2>1961</h2><p>Lived at 15 Sandford Road, Moseley.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2><h3>Bethesda County School report</h3><p>We found this report at my Nan&#39;s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivor Jones has attended this school regularly and punctually for two sessions and a term and during this period he has not progressed much in academic subjects, but has been interested in practical subjects.</p>
<p>He is a quiet lad whose conduct has been most satisfactory and in our experience he is truthful, obediant and reliable. While not likely to succeed in studious pursuits I have no doubt he will succeed in some form of craftwork.</p>
