<h2>1918</h2><p>He and Jane were living in Mancot, near Hawarden, Flintshire which is near Chester.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2><ul>
<li>Was a slate quarryman</li>
<li>&quot;Pretty sure he would have left school at the age of about fourteen and started his working life like most boys at the time in the local Penrhyn Quarry.&quot;  </li>
<li>Security guard in John Summers Shotton Steel</li>
<li>The factory was under contract to the MOD so he could have been semi-military. The factory was then or later owned by DeHaviland. </li>
<li>Died of a heart attack (when Eleanor was nine).</li>
<li>Registered dead in Bangor?</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;He died when he was 49 years old. He was a security officer at a Broughton (near Chester) aircraft factory. They lived in Mancot near where Ellen now lives and your grandmother was born there on April 19th. 1918. He would have been in his early fourties in this photograph!!!&quot;</p>
