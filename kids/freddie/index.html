<h2 id="19-may-2016">19 May 2016</h2>
<p>He was washing his hands and could smell the jacket potatoes cooking.</p>
<p>&quot;Good work, Mummy. That smells great.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="6-march-2016">6 March 2016</h2>
<p>He&#39;d been sick earlier in the day and had a stomach ache. Later on Clare asked him if his stomach still hurt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freddie: No.<br>Clare: Oh, that&#39;s good.<br>Freddie: Now it&#39;s my head. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5-march-2016">5 March 2016</h2>
<p>I&#39;d bought daffodils for my Mum and Nan and Freddie asked if he could have some. His reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody&#39;s ever bought me flowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="14-feb-2016">14 Feb 2016</h2>
<p>I noticed he had &#39;something&#39; up his nose so I squeezed it gently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Is it bothering you?<br>Freddie: No, <strong>you&#39;re</strong> bothering me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="8-feb-2016">8 Feb 2016</h2>
<p>Freddie was reading his book last night and a character said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No problem, baby&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying to get him to read the last word I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a word you say a lot. B ... B ...&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a pause for thought, he looked at me and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Boobs?&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="16-june-2015">16 June 2015</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m really having fun. I&#39;m having a hundred-thousand fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="14-june-2015">14 June 2015</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Freddie: I hope we die in the right order.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="31-may-2015">31 May 2015</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Freddie: How do ghosts fly?<br>Clare: They don&#39;t fly because they&#39;re not real.<br>Freddie: I know, they&#39;re made of blankets.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="13-december-2014">13 December 2014</h2>
<p>We were talking about Christmas and what it means. This lead to talk about Easter and other celebrations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lola: &quot;Christians don&#39;t believe in ghosts.&quot;<br>Freddie: &quot;Ghosts just ... are a blanket.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="18-november-2014">18 November 2014</h2>
<p>Clare was looking in Freddie&#39;s pants to check they were clean.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just rust&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="12-july-2014">12 July 2014</h2>
<p>Comforting his youger brother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oscar, it&#39;s not real life in this world, it&#39;s paper life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="30-nov-2013">30 Nov 2013</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Lola: &quot;Daddy, it&#39;s Christmas soon!&quot;<br>Freddie (poking his head round the door in surprise): &quot;Chips and spoon?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="14-oct-2013">14 Oct 2013</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Daddy, why are you pouring beans on my pants?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="27-may-2013">27 May 2013</h2>
<p>While at the Planetarium, watching the show:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like big moons. I like little moons.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="16-may-2013">16 May 2013</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Mummy: Do you remember being in Mummy&#39;s tummy?<br>Freddie: Yeah.<br>M: How did you get out?<br>F: Pressed the red button.<br>M: Was Lola in Mummy&#39;s tummy?<br>F: Yeah.<br>M: How did she get out?<br>F: The green button.  </p>
