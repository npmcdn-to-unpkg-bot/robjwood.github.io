<h3>27 May 2013</h3><p>While at the Planetarium, watching the show:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like big moons. I like little moons.&quot;</p>
<h3>14 Oct 2013</h3><p>&quot;Daddy, why are you pouring beans on my pants?&quot;</p>
<h3>30 Nov 2013</h3><p>Lola: &quot;Daddy, it&#39;s Christmas soon!&quot;
Freddie (poking his head round the door in surprise): &quot;Chips and spoon?&quot;</p>
<h3>12 July 2014</h3><p>&quot;Oscar, it&#39;s not real life in this world, it&#39;s paper life.&quot;</p>
<h3>November 2014</h3><p>Clare was looking in Freddie&#39;s pants to check they were clean.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just rust&quot;.</p>
<h3>13 December 2014</h3><p>We were talking about Christmas and what it means. This lead to talk about Easter and other celebrations.</p>
<p>Lola: &quot;Christians don&#39;t believe in ghosts.&quot;
Freddie: &quot;Ghosts just ... are a blanket.</p></div></div></div></div><hr><footer><div class="wrapper cf"><div class="grid"><div class="grid__item palm-one-whole one-half testimonial"><p>"Rob worked as a web developer for one of my clients and did an excellent job.
