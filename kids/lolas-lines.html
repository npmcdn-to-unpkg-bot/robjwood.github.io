If we didn&#39;t have Jesus then we wouldn&#39;t have Christmas because it&#39;s his birthday. If we didn&#39;t have God then we wouldn&#39;t even be talking about Christmas, or if we didn&#39;t have Mary. Actually, if we didn&#39;t have Mary then God would have just chosen someone else.&quot;</p>

Me: Tomorrow.
Lola: Oh. Does that mean that he gets birthday presents AND Christmas presents?</p>
<h2>7 Sept 2013</h2><p>We were in Cardiff when Lola was given some fancy seeded bread.</p>
<p>Lola: &#39;I like English brown bread. It doesn&#39;t have seeds in it.&#39;</p>
<h2>6 Sept 2013</h2><p>Me: What language do they speak in London?
Lola: Nearly the same as us.</p>
<h2>23 May 2013</h2><p>Lola: I love you as big as the moon.

<h2>8 April 2013</h2><p>When Ben said he was going to get Granddad, Clare suggested that Lola go with him. I didn&#39;t think there was a child seat in the car so I said, &quot;Have we got a seat?&quot;. Lola&#39;s reply:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s alright, I&#39;ll stand.&quot;</p>
