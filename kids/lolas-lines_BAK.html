<h2>25 July 2010</h2><p>(Pointing at Suzy&#39;s muzzle) Why has that dog got a basket on its mouth?
(Pointing at Dave Hales) What&#39;s that?</p>

<h2>12 August 2010</h2><p>Daddy&#39;s gone to get me some chips (as told to Mummy after I had left the house for work)</p>
<h2>22 September 2010</h2><p>(On me saying goodbye in the morning) Lovely to see you.</p>
<h2>24 November 2010</h2><p>(When taking her bib off) Be careful of my delicate hair.</p>
<h2>4 December 2010</h2><p>(When asked if she wanted to watch Shrek in the lounge) That could work…</p>
<p>30 December 2010</p>
<p>(After whining and holding her nose) My nose just hurt in the kitchen.</p>
<p>16 January 2011</p>
<p>I’ve done two poos! I only needed one.</p>
<p>17 January 2011</p>
<p>Lola: &quot;The Dolphin is putting the letter in the box.&quot;.
Me: &quot;But it’s got no hands&quot;.
Lola: &quot;It’s doing it with its toes.&quot;.
After a long pause: &quot;It will have hands when it’s older&quot;.</p>
<p>21 January 2011</p>
<p>(While Clare only had one hand on the wheel): Mummy, two hands.</p>
<p>10 February 2011</p>

<p>1 July 2011</p>
<p>Ring me if you need me.</p>
<p>23 July 2011</p>
<p>Mummy: I have to say, you were really good at the shops today, so well done.
Lola: She was talking to me, Daddy, not you.</p>
<p>24 July 2011</p>
<p>Look at my two hands; One&#39;s for eating, the other&#39;s for playing with toys.</p>
<p>4 November 2011</p>
<p>Mommy, can we go to the jungle so I can see some unicorns? I want to see them fly.</p>
<p>9 November 2011</p>
<p>My Dream Catcher helped me a lot in the night. My dream was a bit bad but not too bad.</p>

<p>Daddy&#39;s hair smells of poo but mine smells of Roses.</p>
<p>14 January 2012</p>
<p>I want to be a mermaid princess ballerina!</p>
<p>28 February 2012</p>
<p>Daddy: Do you need a poo?
Lola: No, just a wee. (After a splash): Oh, you&#39;re right Daddy! (After another splash): You&#39;re right again!</p>
<p>You need to wipe my bottom so the poo doesn&#39;t go to its other family.</p>
<p>27 April 2012</p>
<p>When we go in the lounge I&#39;ll show you my greatest backflip.</p>

<p>22 September 2012</p>
<p>Lola: I&#39;m so lucky aren&#39;t I?
Clare: Why?
Lola: To have that brother (pointing). He&#39;s fun.</p>
<p>Friday 23rd Nov 2012</p>
<p>Mummy: &quot;When you go back to school I bet you will be making lots of nice Christmas things.&quot;
Lola: &quot;No we won&#39;t Mummy, we are learning about light and dark.&quot;</p>
<p>Wednesday 19 December 2012</p>
<p>&quot;I want to be a doctor or an obstacle teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>Thursday 20 December 2012</p>
<p>On going for a poo, she looked into the bowl and said: &quot;Oh ... my ... WORD!&quot;.</p>
<p>28 January 2013</p>
<p>After her Calpol: &quot;I feel better already!&quot; Crying: &quot;But not as better as I used to be...&quot;</p>
<p>20 March 2013</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t do the splits because I don&#39;t want to break my legs&quot;</p>
<p>8 April 2013</p>
<p>When Ben said he was going to get Granddad, Clare suggested that Lola go with him. I didn&#39;t think there was a child seat in the car so I said, &quot;Have we got a seat?&quot;. Lola&#39;s reply:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s alright, I&#39;ll stand.&quot;</p>
<p>8 April 2031</p>
<p>&quot;Every time Anna Facetimes, she&#39;s always says she&#39;s just got up!&quot;</p>
<p>23 May 2013</p>
<p>&quot;Mommy, your fingers are getting bigger and they don&#39;t fit in my tiny nostrils!&quot;</p>
<p>23 May 2013</p>
<p>Lola: I love you as big as the moon.
Daddy: What happens if Despicable Me steals the moon?
Lola: [Pause] Then I&#39;ll love you as big as a ... [looks around the room] fridge.</p>
<p>6 Sept 2013</p>
<p>Me: What language do they speak in London?
Lola: Nearly the same as us.</p>
<p><strong>7 Sept 2013</strong></p>
<p>We were in Cardiff when Lola was given some fancy seeded bread.</p>
<p>Lola: &#39;I like English brown bread. It doesn&#39;t have seeds in it.&#39;</p>
<p><strong>24 Dec</strong></p>
<p>Lola: Does it hurt to have your ears pierced?
Clare: Yeah, it does actually. Quite a bit.
Lola: Does it hurt less than being punched?</p>
<hr>
<p>Lola: When is Jesus birthday?
Me: Tomorrow.
Lola: Oh. Does that mean that he gets birthday presents AND Christmas presents?</p>
<p><strong>26 Jan 14</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve just unlocked Pascal! I <em>love</em> unlocking stuff!</p>
<p><strong>16 March 2014</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Hugs are for saying &#39;I love you&#39; when you want to save your voice.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>22 May 2014</strong></p>
<p>Describing to me when they were sat in the business class carriage of the train with Clare&#39;s mum.:</p>
<p>&quot;We were posh ... and disabled&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>6 Dec 2014</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Even if we couldn&#39;t find Santa, we&#39;d still have Christmas. If we didn&#39;t have Jesus then we wouldn&#39;t have Christmas because it&#39;s his birthday. If we didn&#39;t have God then we wouldn&#39;t even be talking about Christmas, or if we didn&#39;t have Mary. Actually, if we didn&#39;t have Mary then God would have just chosen someone else.&quot;</p></div></div></div></div><hr><footer><div class="wrapper cf"><div class="grid"><div class="grid__item palm-one-whole one-half testimonial"><p>"Rob worked as a web developer for one of my clients and did an excellent job.
